{"name":"Eugenia-live","tagline":"","body":"Installation\r\n============\r\n\r\n1. Install NPM (by [installing Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)).\r\n2. Clone this Git repository.\r\n3. Install hem: `sudo npm install -g hem`\r\n4. Launch the development server: `hem server -d` or `./server.sh`\r\n\r\nNote, if you are unable to use sudo and install the node modules (and hem) globally, skip sudo command and the -g flag in step 3 and 4.\r\n\r\nThe server can also be started without the \"-d\" option, but this means that the Javascript will be minified on each request and therefore cannot be easily debugged. Another side-effect is that the minifaction of the javascript takes quite long, as several libraries are included.\r\n\r\nDevelopment Dependencies\r\n========================\r\n\r\nTo be able to run the acceptance tests:\r\n\r\n1. `brew update && brew install phantomjs`\r\n2. Install Ruby via RVM\r\n3. Install bundler: `gem install bundler`\r\n4. Install Ruby dependencies: `bundle install`\r\n\r\nRun the acceptance tests with `bundle exec cucumber`\r\n\r\n\r\nDeploying to Heroku\r\n===================\r\n\r\nEnsure that Heroku knows that this is a Javascript (and not a Ruby) app: `heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs`","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
