- Issues
-- Seems to be a conflict of IDs when drawing while loading is occurring (prevent drawing until model has been restored from memory?). This also seems to happen with links sometimes too... clash of ids?
--- I think we need to wait until the drawing has been fully loaded before enabling the drawing tools. Seems to be better now that I've tweaked setup.coffee to install the canvas_renderer first, but there's still a race condition (try creating nodes really quickly when they are already quite a few nodes being loaded).
xx Select tool seems to move nodes in a strange way
xx Select tool does not reconnect links

- Refactoring
-- Revisit tools and tidy up
xx Split out node and link rendering
-- Duplication in renderers?
-- Duplication in models? (Remove model/element?)

- Features
-- Customisable palettes
--- Separate "shape definitions" ("templates"?) from node and link models and renderers
-- Tools
--- Label tool
--- Port tool
--- Compartment tool
