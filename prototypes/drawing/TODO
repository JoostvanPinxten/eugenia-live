- Issues
xx Seems to be a conflict of IDs when drawing while loading is occurring (this was a bug in Spine 1.0.6)
xx Select tool seems to move nodes in a strange way
xx Select tool does not reconnect links

- Refactoring
-- Revisit tools and tidy up
xx Split out node and link rendering
-- Duplication in renderers?
-- Duplication in models? (Remove model/element?)
-- Consider javascript dependency options (Hem / Sprockets)

- Features
-- Customisable palettes
--- Separate "shape definitions" ("templates"?) from node and link models and renderers
-- Tools
--- Label tool
--- Port tool
--- Compartment tool
