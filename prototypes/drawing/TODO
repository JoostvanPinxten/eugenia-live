- Issues
-- Seems to be a conflict of IDs when drawing while loading is occurring (prevent drawing until model has been restored from memory?). This also seems to happen with links sometimes too... clash of ids?

- Refactoring
-- Revisit tools and tidy up
-- Split out node and link rendering
-- Duplication in models? (Remove model/element?)

- Label tool
- Port tool
- Compartment tool
