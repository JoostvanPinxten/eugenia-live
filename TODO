- Customisable palettes
-- Is controller/routing organisation appropriate?
-- Create / update palette items
--- Don't create / update invalid palette items
--- Better error reporting for parsing of JSON and EuGENia
-- Preview palette items (e.g. little icons next to names or a thumbnail shown when hovering)

- Links with arrowheads
-- Trim links at the intersection with nodes
-- Figure out the maths for determining which way the last curve of a path is facing

- Conformance checking
-- Implement the selection view properly
-- Update selection view when the selection in the canvas changes
-- Combo box that can change an element's type
-- Label that can restore deleted shapes to the palette
-- Problems model and marker rendering
-- NodeShape listener that adds markers when a used nodeshape is deleted


- Multiple drawings
-- Add thumbnails to index view:
	var canvas = document.getElementById("mycanvas");
	var img    = canvas.toDataURL("image/png");


- Tools
