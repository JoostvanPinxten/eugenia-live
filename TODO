Issues
- Are there other cyclic requires in models that I can get rid of?
- Does deleting a drawing also delete its nodes and links?
- Sometimes when creating a new (the first new?) drawing and then creating some nodes and links, leaving that page and visiting it again later, the nodes have disappeared!

Features
- Customisable palettes
-- Page for specifying your own palettes
-- Do Palettes, LinkShapes and NodeShapes need to be saved in local storage?
- Multiple drawings
xx Index view
-- Add thumbnails to index view:
	var canvas = document.getElementById("mycanvas");
	var img    = canvas.toDataURL("image/png");
xx Some mechanism for selecting a palette when creating a new drawing
-- Respect palette selection when viewing a drawing
- Links with arrowheads
-- Trim links at the intersection with nodes
-- Figure out the maths for determining which way the last curve of a path is facing
- Tools
-- Label tool
-- Port tool
-- Compartment tool

Testing
- Add unit tests for LinkTool

Refactoring
- Renderers are beginning to look anaemic
